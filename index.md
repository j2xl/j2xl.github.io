# WFH Forever Companies

These companies have permitted employees to work from home (WFH) for indefinite
periods of time based on the news articles linked below. They are presented
in approximately chronological order.

If you'd like to add to this list, please submit a pull request in the
[j2xl.github.io Github repository](https://github.com/j2xl/j2xl.github.io).
Not a Github user? Send me a tip at [wfh@weill.org](mailto:wfh@weill.org).
Please include either a company news release or an article from a credible 
news source. I'm particularly interested in companies that formerly expected
employees to commute to offices, not companies that have always had a WFH
culture.

## Twitter
Employees that do not have a job that requires physical presence, such as
server administrators, will be permitted to work from home indefinitely.

## Square
> “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” a company spokesperson told *The Verge*. “Moving forward, Squares will be able to work from home permanently, even once offices begin to reopen. Over the past several weeks, we’ve learned a lot about what it takes for people to effectively perform roles outside of an office, and we will continue to learn as we go.”

## Facebook
During an all-hands call with employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that 
employees may permanently work from home if they have experience and have a 
strong recent job performance. New hires with less industry experience will 
still be expected to come into offices when possible. Employees that work on 
hardware development and content review will be expected to work in offices.
