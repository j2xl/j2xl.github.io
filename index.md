# WFH Forever Companies

These companies have permitted employees to work from home (WFH) for indefinite
periods of time based on the news articles linked below. They are presented
in approximately chronological order.

If you'd like to add to this list, please submit a pull request in the
[j2xl.github.io Github repository](https://github.com/j2xl/j2xl.github.io).
Not a Github user? Send me a tip at [wfh@weill.org](mailto:wfh@weill.org).
Please include either a company news release or an article from a credible 
news source. I'm particularly interested in companies that formerly expected
employees to commute to offices, not companies that have always had a WFH
culture.
